# mpf_judge_dredd
MPF base configuration for a 1993 Williams Judge Dredd pinball machine

Note that this is not a complete game, or even a complete config. But the basics are there so this is a head start if
you have a physical Judge Dredd machine you'd like to use with MPF.

These files are at #config_version=3. More information on MPF config file versions is here:
