This GitHub repository contains example configuration, demos, and tutorial files for the Mission Pinball Framework. It's
a separate repo from the main MPF project so you can download this folder to an easily-accesible location.

Everything in these folders is licensed via the MIT license, so feel free to use anything you find here for your own
game.

If you're new to MPF, start with the tutorial at http://missionpinball.com/docs/tutorial.

Note that no copyrighted information or intellectual property is included in any of these files. For example, the
"demo_man"" sample machine is not Demolition Man per se, rather it is new code unrelated to Demolition Man which can run
on a 1994 Williams Demolition Man pinball machine.
