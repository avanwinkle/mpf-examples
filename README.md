Mission Pinball Framework Examples
==================================

<img src="mpf-examples-logo.png"/>

This GitHub repository contains example configuration, demos, and tutorial files for the Mission Pinball Framework. It's
a separate repo from the main MPF project so you can download this folder to an easily-accessible location.

The examples here are synchronized to work with the corresonding branches in MPF and the MPF-MC. (e.g. the "master"
branch of mpf-examples works with the master branch of mpf, the dev branch works with the dev branch, etc.)

If you're new to MPF, start with the tutorial at http://missionpinball.com/docs/tutorial.

More details about MPF are here: https://missionpinball.com/mpf/

demo_man
--------
Runnable MPF configuration for a 1994 Williams Demolition Man machine. Note that no copyrighted information or

it's a new MPF game which happens to run on Demolition Man hardware.

mc_demo
-------
A "slide show" demo showing off the features of the MPF Media Controller. You can run this and hit the right and left
arrow keys to step through the slides, and you can check out the config source to see how to do these things in your own
game.

starter_game
------------
A template you can use as a starting point for your own game. This is purely optional. Use it. Or not.

tutorial(s)
-----------
The tutorial folder (and all the folders that start with the name "tutorial") are companion files which you can use to
follow along with the step-by-step tutorial at https://missionpinball.com/tutorial.

wpc_template
--------------------
Contains a template config which you can use as a starting point for a WPC-era machine.

All of these examples are released via the MIT license (same as MPF), which means you can do pretty much anything you
