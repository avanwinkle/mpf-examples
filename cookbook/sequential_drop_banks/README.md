## MPF Cookbook: Sequential Drop Banks

This folder contains a functional MPF game to demonstrate a drop target bank that must be hit sequentially.

For step-by-step instructions on how to use this example, see the MPF Cookbock Documentation.
https://docs.missionpinball.org/cookbook/sequential_drop_banks.html

### Usage

In your MPF environment, navigate to this folder and run MPF.

```
mpf both -x
```

You can control the game by using **Enter** as the start button, **<** and **>** as
the flippers, and **1-4** as the drop targets.

The four dots on the bottom of the screen indicate the state of each drop target.
